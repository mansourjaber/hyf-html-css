     <h2>About me:</h2> 
         <p>I am a naturally talented where I graduated as the first on my
         classmates and after that, I worked in IMC and they trust in my 
         analyzing quickly so they gave me a finished product to work on it
         after a short time from working with them. I worked in IPRC and
         after a month a " thank you letter " had been given to me from the
         manager for organizing the solvent lab according to safety 
         instruction.

         As a teacher, I have been teaching from September 2007 so I am 
         experienced, also I am sympathetic which make my student love me, 
         and their parents also cause I make the children motivated to look 
         for new information.</p>
